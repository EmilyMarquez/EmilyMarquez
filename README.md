I am Emily. I enjoy the exciting process of learning how to code and making interesting things with code. I am very exited about what ways we can use technology in useful ways. I am learning python and my goals to be able to write complex programs through it. Computers and technology are becoming a big part of daily life in humanity. This is why it is important to learn a little bit of algorithms, code, hardware, software, etc. By doing so we can navigate better and be able to see what goes behing the scenes in our electronics.
